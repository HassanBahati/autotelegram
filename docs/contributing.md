## Getting Started

To get started, you should:

1. Fork the [Autotelegram repository](https://github.com/OSCA-Kampala-Chapter/autotelegram) on GitHub

2. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop">Clone your fork</a> to your local machine.
3. Install the development dependencies using ` pip install -r requirements-dev.txt `
4. Read the <a href="https://osca-kampala-chapter.github.io/autotelegram/#welcome-to-autotelegram-documentation">documentation</a> to learn how to use the tool and how to run tests.

## Development Process

We use the GitHub flow for development. These steps are chronological and should be carried out after the steps above(i.e forking the repo) Follow them religiously:

1. Create a new branch for your work(apart from the main branch)
2. Write code and tests on the new branch (probably called dev)
3. Ensure that all tests pass by running pytest
4. Update the documentation if necessary(optional)
5. Stage and commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message
6. Push the staged/committed changes to your fork
7. Merge the changes from the "dev" branch to the main branch
8. Create a pull request to sync your branch/fork with the main branch on the parent repository

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you submit a pull request, please ensure to:

- Include a clear and detailed description of the changes you made
- Reference any issues that your pull request addresses
- Include tests for your changes if possible
- Follow the programming style and conventions used in the existing code
- Update the documentation if necessary or reach out to the maintainers to update it


Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers, who may ask you to make some changes or provide some more information. Please don't hesitate to apply and make the changes. Once the changes are applied, your pull request shall be approved, and it will be merged into the main branch.
